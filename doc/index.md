# nl.frismedia.frisbrowser

This plugin is an alternative to the [Cordova In App Browser Plugin](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser).
The need for this plugin was created when I wanted to style the in app browser to fit my needs, but wasn't able to do that with the In App Browser Plugin.

The plugin is only for iOS at the moment, but Android support will follow soon.

## Installation

    cordova plugin add nl.frismedia.frisbrowser

## Supported Platforms

- iOS

## Sample usage

    FrisBrowser.open(
        'http://www.google.com',
        {
            statusBarStyle: "lightContent", 
            buttonImage: "icon-close.png",
            headerTitleFont: {
                fontName: 'Futura-Medium',
                fontSize: 20,
                fontColor: {r:255,g:255,b:255}
            },
            headerBackgroundColor: {r:29,g:71,b:77},
            buttonColor: {r:255,g:255,b:255}
        }
    );
 
    FrisBrowser.close();
    
- If you're replacing the buttonImage, make sure that image is added to your xcode-project.
- Same goes for the font (see http://iosfonts.com/ for a list of the default fonts and their names)
- statusBarStyle can be "default" (black text) or "lightContent" (white text)
